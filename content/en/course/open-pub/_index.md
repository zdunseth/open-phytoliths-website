## What the project is about

### Development of the guidelines

The open publishing guidelines were requested to be developed by the International Committee on Open Phytolith Science by Doris Barboni. The guidelines are initially for use in the special issue on Phytoliths in Asia for the journal - *Review of Palaeobotany and Palynology*. 

This will be the first of its kind to ask authors to comply with good open science practices for all of the submissions and we offer these guidelines about best practice to assist authors.
